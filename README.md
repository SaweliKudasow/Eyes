# 👀 Cursor Tracker

A small interactive web project where **two eyes follow your mouse cursor** and **blink naturally** — just like real ones.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project demonstrates simple yet smooth animation and user interactivity in the browser.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧿 Eyes smoothly follow your mouse pointer  
- 😴 Auto sleep mode when inactive (eyes close after a few seconds)  
- 😉 Random blinking for a more natural look  
- 💻 Responsive design — works on any screen size  
- ⚡ Lightweight and pure JavaScript (no libraries)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- **JavaScript** calculates the direction from each eye’s center to the mouse position.  
- **Pupils** move toward that direction smoothly using a simple interpolation formula.  
- **CSS animations** handle blinking by scaling the eyelid element vertically.  
- If no user activity (mouse, keyboard, or touch) is detected for 3.5 seconds, the eyes "fall asleep."
